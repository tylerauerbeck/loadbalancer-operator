# loadbalanceroperator 

**Note:** loadbalanceroperator is currently under active (and early) development and is likely to change quite frequently.

## Development

We recommend using the supported `devcontainer` provided in this repository, other local setups are not supported (and your milage may vary). It is already configured with all of the appropriate toolings.  The provided development environment will spin up the additional tooling you required including:
- nats configured with necessary queues
- preconfigured required environment variables
- necessary haproxy chart
- kind kubernetes cluster
